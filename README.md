# Market point

## Minecraft versions

MarketPoint is compatible with the following minecraft versions

- 1.16.x - 1.17.x 

It might work with even lower versions up to MC 1.13, but I haven't tested it.

## How to compile?

1. Clone the project
2. Type `mvn install`
3. `.jar` file should appear in `target` folder
